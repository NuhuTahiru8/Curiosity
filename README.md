# Curiosity

# The first chapter in my life where a tale of curiosity, discovery, and the pursuit of knowledge started

## I love thinking about idea of something and realizing/discussing it.

In the quiet town where I spent my early years, the concept of computers was as alien as the farthest reaches of the universe. **However, destiny had a curious way of weaving itself into the tapestry of my childhood.**

It all began when I was a wide-eyed eight-year-old navigating through primary school. Little did I know that within the walls of my humble institution lay a portal to a world of wonders – the **I.C.T Lab**. **This I.C.T Lab** held the keys to a realm that shape the fascination of the things i have done and **years to come.**

**Through this Lab my heart found its true calling, and that is computers**

*Encarta Kids*, in those days, was our *Google*, a treasure trove of knowledge divided into subjects and topics. Amidst this digital encyclopedia, my heart found its true calling in the subject like **Astronomy**. The celestial section held the allure of faraway planets, the daring escapades of astronauts, and the sheer awesomeness of outer space.

But the revelations didn't stop there. Another enchanted portal opened before me – *Mavis Beacon Teaching Typing*. How could such magic exist? The cacophony of thoughts echoed in my mind. The yearning for more knowledge surged within me, especially considering we didn't own a television at home.

Every chance to enter the **I.C.T Lab** was a pilgrimage, an opportunity to unravel the mysteries that danced through my imagination. I bombarded anyone who seemed remotely knowledgeable about computers with questions, only to find blank stares and shrugs in return.

Then, one day, destiny winked at me. As I stepped into my home after closing from school, a peculiar sight awaited me – a computer, quietly occupying a corner of our bedroom. The cosmic coincidence was not lost on me.

However, skepticism crept in. This marvel couldn't possibly be for me, and my instincts proved correct when my father returned from word. His eyes caught me infront of the computer, and he posed a simple question – can you operate it? With a nod, I affirmed my ability, almost surprised at my own confidence.

*"Then switch it on,"* he declared. And so, with a click, the machine came to life. As the screen flickered to reveal a world beyond my imagination, I couldn't help but ask the burning question – who was this technological marvel for?

The revelation left me in disbelief. It wasn't destined for me but for a family member my father had assisted in establishing an Internet cafe in the city. Yet, fate had a sense of irony. The computer, adorned only with a couple of reggae songs, lacked the symphony of speakers. It stood as a silent testament to both the possibilities and limitations of my newfound obsession.

And so, in the quietude of our home, surrounded by the muted beats of reggae, my journey into the enigmatic world of computers began. Little did I know that this seemingly ordinary moment would become the first chapter in a tale of curiosity, discovery, and the pursuit of knowledge.

## To be continue
